My final project is a very basic blackjack game where a player has three tries to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
The player wins the game by either getting to 21 or by beating the dealer's score.
The player loses if they go over 21 or if their final score is not higher than the dealer's. 
The dealer also loses if they get over 21. The player automatically wins.
Number cards are worth their face value and court cards (only the King is present here) are worth 11 points.
Traditionally, aces are worth either 1 or 11 depending on what the player needs, but for simplicity, it has a default value of 1.
